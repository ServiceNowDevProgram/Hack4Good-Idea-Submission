        <problem_statement>Many organizations struggle to effectively gather and analyze feedback from beneficiaries, volunteers, and stakeholders. Traditional feedback systems—such as manual surveys or emails—are time-consuming, inconsistent, and often result in poor data quality. Additionally, tracking the real-world impact of programs or initiatives becomes difficult when feedback is scattered across multiple sources or formats. This lack of structured insight limits the ability to improve services, measure outcomes, and demonstrate transparency.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>The <strong>Feedback &amp; Impact Collection App</strong> would allow users (beneficiaries, volunteers, or partners) to easily submit feedback via a self-service portal or mobile interface.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Feedback forms could be dynamically generated based on project type or user role.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Submitted feedback would automatically trigger workflows for review, categorization, and escalation if issues are identified.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dashboards would visualize trends such as satisfaction levels, recurring issues, and overall project impact over time.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A sentiment analysis feature could be integrated to identify positive and negative feedback automatically.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Organizations could also share periodic “impact reports” summarizing collected feedback and actions taken—building transparency and accountability.</p>
</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>
<p>Access to the <strong>ServiceNow App Engine</strong> for building custom tables and workflows.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Integration with email or SMS gateways (for feedback notifications and reminders).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Optional integration with third-party analytics tools or sentiment analysis APIs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Role-based access configurations to ensure secure data collection and review.</p>
</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>
<p>Ensuring <strong>user adoption</strong>, especially among non-technical or remote users.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Designing forms and workflows flexible enough to handle multiple project types.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Managing <strong>data privacy and security</strong>, especially when collecting personal or sensitive feedback.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Integrating real-time analytics or external systems without performance degradation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Establishing a consistent process for verifying and acting on collected feedback.</p>
</li></ol>]]></solution_proposal>
