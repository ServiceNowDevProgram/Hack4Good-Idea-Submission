        <problem_statement>During disasters, communication networks often fail, leaving people unable to send alerts or share their location. Rescue teams struggle to find victims or assess their health in real time, delaying help. The lack of a unified platform for updates and coordination causes confusion and inefficient aid distribution. Limited real-time data also weakens overall disaster response and recovery efforts.</problem_statement>
