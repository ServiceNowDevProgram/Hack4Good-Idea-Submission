        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>- Help citizens securely upload and timestamp evidence for legal use<br />- Enable NGOs and legal clinics to track reports, assign follow-ups, and issue QR-linked case IDs<br />- Provide sponsor dashboards showing reporting trends, regional impact, and justice outcomes<br />- Foster community trust through transparent workflows and anonymous options<br />- Improve access to justice and reduce fear of retaliation </p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Citizens often witness or experience incidents - harassment, fraud, abuse, civic violations but lack a secure, structured way to preserve evidence and report it legally. Screenshots, videos, and voice notes get lost or deleted, and many fear retaliation or don’t know how to escalate safely. NGOs and legal clinics want to help, but lack scalable tools for evidence intake and follow-up.&#13;
This leads to underreporting, lost justice opportunities, and emotional distress.</problem_statement>
