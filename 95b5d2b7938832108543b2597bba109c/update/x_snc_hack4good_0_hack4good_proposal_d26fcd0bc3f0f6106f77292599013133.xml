        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>FoodShield creates a real-time donation network that connects surplus food suppliers with NGOs, shelters and community kitchens. Using barcode scanning or inventory APIs, businesses can upload details of near-expiry food items, and the system automatically matches them with nearby recipients based on quantity, freshness and location.</p>
<p>IoT-based temperature sensors ensure food quality during transit, while automated pickup scheduling and tracking ensure efficiency. Dashboards display environmental impact metrics like meals saved, CO₂ emissions prevented and food rescued per location, turning sustainability into measurable action.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Restaurants, supermarkets, and cafeterias often discard tons of food daily due to nearing expiry or slight overproduction. Simultaneously, NGOs and shelters struggle to feed people in need. Lack of real-time coordination causes unnecessary food waste and hunger.</problem_statement>
