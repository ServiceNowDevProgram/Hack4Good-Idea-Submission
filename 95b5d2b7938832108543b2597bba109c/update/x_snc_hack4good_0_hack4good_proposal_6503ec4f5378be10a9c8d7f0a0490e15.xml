        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>A smart outage detection system would enable faster fault identification, automated crew dispatch, and transparent communication with affected communities. It would enhance grid reliability, reduce downtime, and promote equitable access to energy, particularly in underserved areas.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Power outages disrupt homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure, yet many utility providers still rely on manual fault detection and slow response workflows. Without real-time visibility into outage patterns or grid vulnerabilities, service restoration is delayed and customer trust erodes.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>ServiceNow Products or Capabilities Used:</p>
<p>CMDB – Track grid assets, substations, and outage zones.</p>
<p>SACM – Manage the full lifecycle of grid assets with clear roles, policies, and configuration tracking.</p>
<p>IntegrationHub – Connect with smart meters and grid monitoring systems.</p>
<p>ITSM – Log outage incidents and service restoration workflows.</p>
<p>Field Service Management – Dispatch repair crews based on location and urgency.</p>
<p>Performance Analytics – Monitor outage frequency, duration, and response times.</p>
<p>Service Portal – Residents and businesses can report outages and track resolution.</p>
<p>Flow Designer – Automate fault alerts, crew assignments, and status updates.</p>
<p>ESG Management – Report on energy reliability and infrastructure resilience.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Integration with smart grid APIs, smart meters, and geolocation services.</p>
<p>Secure data ingestion and mapping of outage zones to CMDB records.</p>
<p>Mobile access for field teams and real-time sync with dispatch systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Coordinating with utility providers and infrastructure owners, ensuring real-time data accuracy and system scalability, designing intuitive dashboards for both technical teams and the public, and managing service-level agreements and prioritization during large-scale outages.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
