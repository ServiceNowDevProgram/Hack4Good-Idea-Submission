        <problem_statement>After floods, earthquakes, or cyclones, thousands of families lose their homes and livelihoods. Relief aid often arrives in silos — multiple agencies collect duplicate data, causing delays and uneven resource allocation. Families struggle to track their applications for housing reconstruction or financial support. Governments and NGOs lack a transparent, centralized view of progress and accountability.</problem_statement>
