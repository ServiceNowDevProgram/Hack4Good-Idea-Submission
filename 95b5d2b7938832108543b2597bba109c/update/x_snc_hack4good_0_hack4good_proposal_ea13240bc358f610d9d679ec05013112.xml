        <problem_statement>Old water pipes and utility systems often have hidden leaks that waste a lot of clean water every day. This wasted water is called "Non-Revenue Water" because it never reaches customers and can't be billed. It's a huge loss not just of water, but also of energy and money. The problem is, utility companies don’t have a quick and organized way to find these leaks or send repair teams to fix them efficiently.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>A central platform that turns leak reports and sensor data into prioritized, dispatchable repair jobs:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Citizen App (Mobile Portal):</strong> People can quickly report a visible leak (with a photo and location), turning a common complaint into a vital piece of data.</li><li><strong>Smart Work Dispatch (Field Service Management):</strong> The system automatically categorizes the leak report, checks the location against pipe infrastructure data, and sends the closest available maintenance crew directly to the site using the shortest route.</li><li><strong>Sensor Integration:</strong> Connects to <em>Internet of Things (IoT)</em> sensors already installed in the pipes. If a sensor detects low pressure, the system automatically creates an emergency repair ticket.</li><li><strong>Impact Tracking:</strong> Dashboards show the &#34;Water Saved&#34; (in liters) and the &#34;Time to Repair,&#34; proving the immediate environmental and financial benefits.</li></ul>
