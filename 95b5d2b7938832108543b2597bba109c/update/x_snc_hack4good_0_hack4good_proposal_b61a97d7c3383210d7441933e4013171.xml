        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>MarketTrust could enable millions of traders to access microloans, insurance, and supplier credit by creating verified digital business identities. Within a year, it could help increase small business income by 20–30% and bring transparency to informal trade transactions.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Over 60% of urban workers in Africa operate in the informal sector without access to credit or banking services. Traders often lack formal records, making it difficult for financial institutions to assess their reliability. This results in lost opportunities, poor business growth, and continued financial exclusion.</problem_statement>
