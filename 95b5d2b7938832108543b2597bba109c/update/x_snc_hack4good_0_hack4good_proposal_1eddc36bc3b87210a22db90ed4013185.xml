        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>MedServe would streamline healthcare outreach operations, automating patient registration, doctor scheduling, and follow-up care to increase efficiency and expand patient reach.<br /><br />The system would reduce patient registration time by 50%, increase patient service coverage by 35%, and provide centralized data reporting for donors and stakeholders.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Nonprofit medical missions face significant inefficiencies in coordinating healthcare services because most rely on manual scheduling, paper-based patient tracking, and ad hoc communication. This lack of centralized coordination leads to scheduling conflicts, data loss, delayed reporting, and difficulty measuring impact, ultimately limiting the reach and effectiveness of healthcare outreach programs in underserved communities.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>A ServiceNow-powered healthcare coordination platform with modules for scheduling, patient feedback, and volunteer doctor assignments.</p>
<p>The solution would use Field Service Management for scheduling field clinics, Now Mobile for field data entry by volunteers, and App Engine Studio to create a secure patient management interface.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>It would rely on Electronic Health Record (EHR) APIs, cloud-based databases for patient data, and SMS gateways for appointment confirmations and reminders.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Potential challenges include ensuring compliance with healthcare data privacy laws (HIPAA/GDPR), maintaining data integrity, and training field staff on using digital tools effectively.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
