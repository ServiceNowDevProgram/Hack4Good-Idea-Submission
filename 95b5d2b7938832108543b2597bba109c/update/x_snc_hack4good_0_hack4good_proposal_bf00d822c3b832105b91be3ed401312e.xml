        <problem_statement>Many individuals have neurodevelopmental differences—such as ADHD, Down Syndrome, autism, or dyslexia—that affect how they learn and interact with digital content. Traditional learning platforms are often not designed to accommodate these differences, leading to challenges such as:&#13;
Difficulty focusing, retaining information, or completing tasks.&#13;
Frustration due to complex interfaces or fast-paced lessons.&#13;
Limited tools for caregivers and educators to monitor and support progress.&#13;
There is a clear need for a digital learning platform that is adaptive, accessible, and supportive, allowing neurodiverse learners to engage at their own pace and in ways that suit their cognitive and sensory needs.</problem_statement>
