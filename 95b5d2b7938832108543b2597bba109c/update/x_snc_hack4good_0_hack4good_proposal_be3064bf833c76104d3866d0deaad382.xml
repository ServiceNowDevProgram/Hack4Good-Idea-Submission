        <problem_statement>Low immunization rates, particularly for non-mandatory public health vaccines (e.g., seasonal flu shots, Tdap boosters), are often due to a combination of misinformation and access barriers.

<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>PA<br />Campining Management</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Geolocation: Critical for mapping provider locations and targeting local alerts.</p>
<p>Provider Integration: Requires lightweight, secure APIs or manual processes for clinics/pharmacies to update real-time inventory and appointment slots</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Data Trust and Verification: Establishing credibility and trust as a source of verified health information, requiring strong partnership with local health departments.</p>
<p>Provider Participation: Gaining buy-in from busy, disparate private healthcare providers (pharmacies, clinics) to consistently update their real-time inventory.</p>
<p>HIPAA/Privacy: While the system is non-clinical, any feature involving personal health history (like the family scheduler) must be built with strict security and privacy control</p>]]></solution_proposal>
