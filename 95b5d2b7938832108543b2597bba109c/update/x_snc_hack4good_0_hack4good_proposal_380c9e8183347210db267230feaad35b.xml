        <problem_statement>SafeZone - Provides real-time infection control updates, automatically syncing signage, alerts, and staff notifications.&#13;
In LTC homes and community care facilities, infection prevention and control (IPAC) compliance is critical but often relies on manual observation and delayed reporting. Paper signs on resident doors and verbal reminders can be outdated, leading to:&#13;
&#13;
Staff entering rooms without proper PPE&#13;
Reuse of gloves between residents&#13;
Inconsistent hand hygiene by staff and residents&#13;
Delayed identification of potential infection risks&#13;
&#13;
Additional benefit: Using AI, SafeZone can analyze video feeds in real time to detect:&#13;
Staff donning or doffing PPE incorrectly&#13;
Improper glove use between residents&#13;
Frequency and correctness of hand hygiene&#13;
Resident hand sanitizer compliance during care&#13;
&#13;
This approach allows real-time intervention before outbreaks occur, rather than waiting for retrospective review.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>ServiceNow products or capabilities used:</p>
<ul><li>App Engine Studio – build the SafeZone application, resident and staff tables, and IPAC dashboards</li><li>Flow Designer – automate alerts, task assignments, and escalations when non-compliance is detected</li><li>Service Portal / Mobile App – provide real-time notifications and compliance dashboard for staff and supervisors</li><li>Performance Analytics – track compliance rates, frequent violations, and improvement trends</li><li>IntegrationHub – ingest video analysis results and integrate with resident and staff databases</li><li>Inbound / Outbound REST APIs – receive AI video analysis results and send notifications to ServiceNow tasks</li><li>Notification &amp; Event Management – trigger alerts to responsible staff in real-time</li><li>Role-based Access Control (ACLs) – restrict sensitive IPAC and resident data to authorized personnel</li><li>AI Video Analysis (external integration) – detect PPE compliance, hand hygiene, and glove reuse; optionally flag urgent incidents</li><li>MID Server – if local video feeds need secure on-premise processing</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Technical dependencies:</p>
<ul><li>Camera/video feed infrastructure within the LTC facility</li><li>AI video analysis service capable of real-time PPE and hygiene detection</li><li>Resident and staff master data for mapping video observations</li><li>Secure network to integrate video analysis results into ServiceNow</li><li>Mobile or desktop devices for staff notifications and dashboard access</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Anticipated challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Ensuring privacy and consent for video recording in care areas</li><li>High computational load for real-time video AI processing</li><li>Training AI models to accurately recognize PPE, gloves, and hand hygiene actions in different lighting and angles</li><li>Integrating external AI video service results with ServiceNow in real-time</li><li>Staff adaptation to receiving real-time compliance feedback</li></ul>]]></solution_proposal>
