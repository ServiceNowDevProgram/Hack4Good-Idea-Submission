        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>A technology platform would make it faster and easier for communities to mobilize volunteers, ensuring that help reaches people in need more efficiently and equitably. Technology would reduce the reliance on larger organizations or paid services and allow community members to connect directly with each other. </p>
<p>By tracking activities and outcomes, organizations could better understand community needs, measure impact, and plan resources more effectively.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>A volunteer coordination app that matches people in a community with requests for help—grocery deliveries for seniors, tutoring for students, home repairs for those in need—based on availability and location.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Service Portal<br />App Engine<br />AI for a matching algorithm<br /><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Integration with a mapping solution would be nice to show the approximate areas of required service, perhaps.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Making it as simple a UI as possibly to have the widest reach of audience - especially for seniors and folks with lower tech literacy.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
