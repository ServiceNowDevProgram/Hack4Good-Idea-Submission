        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>A digital reporting and tracking platform would enable residents to quickly log maintenance issues, attach photos, and receive status updates. Councils could prioritise repairs based on urgency, track contractor performance, and reduce backlog times by up to 50%.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Many UK council tenants struggle to report issues like damp, leaks, or heating faults in their homes. Reports are often made via phone calls or emails and can get lost or delayed, leaving residents in unsafe conditions and increasing long-term repair costs for councils.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Use <strong>ServiceNow Customer Service Management</strong> for case handling, <strong>Flow Designer</strong> for automated routing to the right maintenance team, and <strong>Mobile App Builder</strong> to let tenants submit issues via phone. <strong>Performance Analytics</strong> dashboards could give councils insights into housing quality trends.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Integration with council housing databases, contractor scheduling tools, and optional SMS/email notification services (Twilio or SendGrid).</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Ensuring all tenants have digital access, verifying genuine housing reports, and coordinating responses with third-party maintenance contractors.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
