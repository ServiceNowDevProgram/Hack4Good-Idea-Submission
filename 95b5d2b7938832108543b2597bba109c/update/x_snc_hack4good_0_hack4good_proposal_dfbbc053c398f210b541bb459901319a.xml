        <problem_statement>All big Organizations require plan/manage their employees' domestic/international corporate travels and typically they use different separate applications to raise travel requests, track the requests, request for VISAs and book the tickets etc.&#13;
Organizations can use their ServiceNow platform to have an application where an employee can raise travel request, which goes for approvals and post necessary approvals travel team can manage/track the request in ServiceNow. The travel team can be redirected to VISA portal for applying for VISA (if required) and to the approved travel booking sites for booking travel tickets/hotels and all.&#13;
&#13;
Management can have reports on quarterly/half-yearly/yearly basis to have sufficient budget allocated on travel expenses.</problem_statement>
