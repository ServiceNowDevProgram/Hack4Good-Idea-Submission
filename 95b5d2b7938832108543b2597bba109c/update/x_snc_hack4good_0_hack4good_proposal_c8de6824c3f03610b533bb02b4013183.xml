        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>Transforming the onboarding process from a manual or scattered process into a centralized, engaging journey. Here the freshers can find all important information, be it any training materials or to-do tasks or any policies of their organization. Trainers can track the progress made by each fresher. Quiz based evaluations, assignment submissions will also be available. Reminders will also be there to make sure everyone is compliant.</p>
<p>So, hundreds or thousands of freshers can be smoothly onboarded.</p>]]></potential_impact>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Custom Tables to store data for Fresher/new employee, Onboarding Tasks, Training Modules.</p>
<p>Service Portal or UI Builder to create an interactive UI that will appear in front-end.</p>
<p>Pages will include - Dashboards (Progress tracker), Training, my tasks, Mentor connect, FAQ or KB articles.</p>
<p>Reminder Notifications based on automated flows.</p>
<p>Access Control of different tabs or sections for Fresher and Trainer.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>HTML, CSS, AngularJS along with client controller and server script knowledge to design the widgets for the Portal.</p>
<p>Otherwise, good experience on UI Builder to design Workspace or Portal themed UI.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>There will be difficult customizations and integrations might also be involved to send or fetch data. Also testing with few records won&#39;t reveal performance or usability issues that might arise when hundreds of freshers use at once.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
