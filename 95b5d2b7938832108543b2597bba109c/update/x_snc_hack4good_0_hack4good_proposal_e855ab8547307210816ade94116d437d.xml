        <problem_statement>Students face confusion between departments for IT, academic, or hostel-related issues.&#13;
In most educational institutions, students struggle to find the right contact or channel for resolving academic, hostel, or IT-related issues. Currently, these queries are handled manually through emails or physical visits, leading to confusion, delayed resolutions, and lack of accountability. Different departments work in silos, and there is no unified tracking or escalation mechanism for service requests.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><h3>Tell us more about how you envision the ideal solution to this problem</h3>
<p>EduHelpDesk would serve as a one-stop digital support center for all student-related issues.<br />Students log requests through a self-service Service Portal or mobile app by selecting the category (IT, Hostel, Library, Academic, etc.).<br />The system automatically:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Routes the ticket to the appropriate department based on request type.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Triggers notifications to assigned staff.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tracks progress until closure with SLA monitoring.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collects feedback from students post-resolution.</p>
</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>
<p>App Engine Studio – to build custom tables and forms for departments, requests, and SLAs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Flow Designer – for automated request routing, escalations, and notifications.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Service Catalog – for predefined categories like IT Request, Academic Query, or Hostel Complaint.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Service Portal – as the student-facing interface for request submission and tracking.</p>
</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>Access to institutional master data like students, departments, and staff directory</li><li>Integration with existing campus systems like ID management system,ERP etc</li></ol>]]></solution_proposal>
