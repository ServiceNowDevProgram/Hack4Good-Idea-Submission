        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>Improved water safety, faster response to contamination, and greater community engagement. It enables authorities to detect patterns early, respond to leaks or pollution, and maintain public trust through transparency.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Many UK communities experience poor water quality or contamination but lack an easy way to report or track issues. Reporting is slow, fragmented, and often reactive, causing health and environmental risks.</problem_statement>
        <project_name>AquaWatch – Citizen Water Quality Reporting and Alert System</project_name>
        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>A mobile and web based platform powered by ServiceNow where citizens can report water issues (color, odor, contamination) with photos and GPS data.<br />AI analyzes patterns, prioritizes urgent cases, and routes incidents to local councils or water authorities. Dashboards show live water quality trends for both citizens and officials.</p>
<p><strong>ServiceNow products used:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM)</strong> for citizen reports and case routing</li><li><strong>ServiceNow Predictive Intelligence</strong> for AI based prioritization</li><li><strong>ServiceNow Flow Designer</strong> for automating alerts and task assignments</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Integration with water authority APIs, IoT sensors for live water quality data, and optional mobile geolocation services.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Ensuring data accuracy from public reports, integrating across different councils and water providers, and maintaining public data privacy.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
