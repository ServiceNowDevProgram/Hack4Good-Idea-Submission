        <problem_statement>In today’s consumer-driven society, many individuals purchase specialized and expensive gear/equipment for short-term or one-time use according to their needs. This leads to impulsive buying, clutter, and increased environmental waste.&#13;
There is a lack of a unified platform where individuals can securely, locally, and transparently rent or lend items, with clear rental terms and caution deposits, ensuring mutual benefit and promoting sustainability.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p><strong>ServiceNow Studio</strong>: For creating and managing the custom application (tables, scripts, UI components). </p>
<p><strong>Service Portal / Now Mobile App</strong>: Provides a modern, user-friendly interface for browsing and managing rental listings as well as on phone.</p>
<p><strong>Flow Designer</strong>: Automates core workflows such as rental requests, approvals, payment notifications, and return confirmations. </p>
<p><strong>Now Assist (GenAI)</strong>: Summarizes user reviews, provides feedback scores, and recommends improvements to listings. </p>
<p><strong>ACLs</strong>:<strong> </strong>Secure item and user records and fields based on roles like renter, consumer.</p>
<p><strong>REST APIs and Integration Hub</strong>: Used to connect with external APIs (payment, messaging, national ID authentication). </p>
<p><strong>Reports and Dashboard</strong>: Track rental activity and metrics, and a dashboard to monitor rental requests.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Proposed solution will rely on several external technologies, APIs, and tools to ensure smooth operation-</p>
<ol><li>Payment Gateway API- For collecting caution deposits and daily rental charges securely. </li><li>National ID Provider API- For authenticating the national ID number</li><li>Digital Signature API- For users to digitally sign rental agreements. etc.</li><li>Natural Language Processing API- To summarize user feedback and generate listing insights or quality scores. </li><li>Fraud Detection API- Detects suspicious activity like fake listings or repeated cancellations.</li><li>Option for inclusion of Logistics &amp; Delivery services during later stage of the product.</li></ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>Integrating with external payment gateways (Razorpay, PayPal, etc.) securely can be tricky.</li><li>
<p>Handling refunds of deposits, transaction failures, and partial payments requires careful workflow and API management.</p>
</li><li>Handling disputes (e.g., item damage, non-returns) requires additional business logic and governance.</li><li>Storing personal user data (address, contact details, ID proofs) and financial information (deposits, payments) must comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).  </li></ol>]]></solution_proposal>
