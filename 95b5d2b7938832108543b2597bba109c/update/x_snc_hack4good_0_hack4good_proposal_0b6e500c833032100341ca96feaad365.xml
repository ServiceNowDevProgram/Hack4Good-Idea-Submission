        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>A good start is to have clear visibility on the supplies and incoming demand to respond swiftly and have prior agreement with suppliers to allow for flexibility for flow of supplies.<br />Provide timely, data-backed insights for supply management.<br />Scalable to allow more supplies contacts for contingencies.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Food and Beverage business tend to struggle with food allocation and wastage issue, especially in time where demand for their food menus fluctuates greatly.&#13;
Certain mitigations as such reducing food offering prices nearer to closing proves costly as customer may wait out for the closing deal hours. In most cases, food are left to perish and could have been put into use otherwise.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Contract Management - Manage OLA with suppliers<br />Workflow Engine - Rule based workflow to trigger request for supply on stockpile threshold or menu restriction<br />AI Prompt - Formulate Menu offering for the day based on surplus of supplies/ingredients<br />CMDB Asset - Link various supply to suppliers<br />Flow Designer - Food Offering recommendations, and Stock Up reminders.<br />Virtual Agent - Conversational guide to formulate recipe based on available ingredients.<br />Performance Analytics - Visualizes order trends and insights for stockpiling of ingredients.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Integration with Suppliers Ordering Systems for stream-less interaction.<br />Notification services for reminders and recommendations.<br />Optional AI services for food offering personalization.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Supplier market where prices are not fixed, quality of ingredients is questionable<br />Partnering with suppliers for co-adoption and trust in the supply chain.<br />Delivery or reciept of ingredient is not in time to cope with incoming demand</p>]]></solution_proposal>
