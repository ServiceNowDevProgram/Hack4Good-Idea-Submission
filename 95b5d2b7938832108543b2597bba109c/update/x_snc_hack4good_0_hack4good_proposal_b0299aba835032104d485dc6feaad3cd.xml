<p>This app would streamline access to aid by allowing queer and trans individuals to request or offer help in a single, secure location. Which reduces the reliance on scattered social media posts and spreadsheets and also reduces the administrative overhead for organizers and volunteers.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This would accelerate response times by automating matching between help requests and people that can offer help.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This would provide better visibility to community resources such as affirming clinics, housing, or legal aid in a searchable, map-based directory.</p>
</li><li>
<p>This would also foster sustainable community networks by encouraging ongoing mutual aid relationships rather than one-time transactions, building resilience within queer and trans communities.</p>

        <problem_statement>Queer and trans people often face barriers when seeking basic support — from emergency funds to safe housing to mental health resources. In the face of growing efforts to erase queer and trans identities, these barriers have only intensified. While mutual aid networks exist, they are often fragmented across social media, spreadsheets, and word of mouth This makes it difficult for people in crisis to find timely, reliable, and trustworthy help — and for organizers to manage requests efficiently and safely.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Service Portal:</strong> for a user-friendly front-end for submitting or responding to mutual aid requests.</li><li><strong>Case or Request Management:</strong> to help track and manage each aid request from submission to resolution.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Managmemt: </strong>to help track information about resources or an FAQ page.</li><li><strong>Flow Designer:</strong> to add automation such as automatically assign “Housing” requests to volunteers tagged to that category (or group).</li><li><strong>Integration Hub: </strong>to bring in data from external data sources such as legacy spreadsheets, to send out slack notifications or even automate social media posts</li><li><strong>Now Assist/GenAI:</strong> to suggest resources or next steps for requesters based on their need type.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li>An instance with Generative AI capabilities</li><li>Integrations with 3rd-party systems in order to get access to resources and infromation</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li>Ensuring user privacy and safety, especially for vulnerable users</li><li>Preventing misuse or fraudulent aid requests.</li><li>Building community trust in the platform.</li><li>Maintaining up-to-date resource and volunteer data.</li></ul>]]></solution_proposal>
