        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>CultureBridge acts as a digital hub that connects artisans, cultural organizations and supporters.</p>
<ul><li>Artisans can register their craft, upload photos or videos of their work, and apply for funding or training programs.</li><li>NGOs and cultural departments can verify artisans, organize workshops and manage grant distribution through one system.</li><li>Sponsors or citizens can discover local artisans and directly contribute or purchase their work.</li></ul>
<p>This solution helps revive endangered skills, promotes regional crafts globally and gives artisans stable income opportunities. It also enables governments to measure the success of heritage programs through real-time data like “skills revived,” “artisans trained,” and “funds distributed.”</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Traditional art forms, crafts and regional skills are disappearing as younger generations migrate to cities or switch to modern jobs. Many artisans don’t have digital knowledge, marketing reach or access to funding. Government programs to support them often work in isolation, without a single platform to manage, track and promote these cultural assets. As a result, priceless heritage and livelihoods are slowly fading away.</problem_statement>
