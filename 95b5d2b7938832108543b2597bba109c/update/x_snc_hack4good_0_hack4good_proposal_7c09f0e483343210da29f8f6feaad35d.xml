        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p><strong>GreenTrack</strong> is an <strong>AI-driven sustainability and waste management solution</strong> built on <strong>ServiceNow</strong>. It enables cities, universities, and enterprises to track recycling, waste collection, and energy usage while encouraging eco-friendly behavior through gamification.</p>
<p>Using <strong>Now Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>, the system analyzes waste data from IoT bins, sensors, and reports, predicts collection needs, and recommends resource optimization strategies. Employees or citizens can log waste or recycling activity through the <strong>Service Portal</strong>, while <strong>Flow Designer</strong> automates task routing for sanitation teams.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>GreenTrack</strong> can reduce waste management costs by <strong>20–30%</strong> through optimized collection routes and predictive scheduling. It promotes recycling engagement by up to <strong>50%</strong> through user incentives and awareness campaigns. Real-time analytics will allow organizations to measure sustainability KPIs and make data-driven environmental decisions.</p>
<p>Overall, this platform drives measurable environmental progress, improves operational efficiency, and strengthens community participation in sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>Dashboards powered by <strong>Performance Analytics</strong> show waste reduction trends, carbon footprint metrics, and environmental scorecards for leadership review.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Communities and organizations struggle with tracking waste generation, recycling progress, and sustainability compliance. Data is often scattered across reports and spreadsheets, making it difficult to measure environmental impact or encourage responsible behavior. There’s a need for a unified, intelligent platform that promotes sustainability transparency and action.</problem_statement>
