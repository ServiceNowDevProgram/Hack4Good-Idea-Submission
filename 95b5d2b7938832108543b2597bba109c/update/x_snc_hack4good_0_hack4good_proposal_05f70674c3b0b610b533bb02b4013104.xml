        <problem_statement>Every person needs to track the trend of their life, be it their expenses or health data or learning. This way everyone can visualize the up down curve of their daily life. We should not go out of limit in terms of expenses or healthy lifestyle or learning period. If we know, we are on track or need to improve the curve, many of the problems in life will be gone.</problem_statement>
