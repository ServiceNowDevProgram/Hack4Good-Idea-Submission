        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>CiviRelief is a unified disaster response and community coordination platform that connects residents, responders, and relief agencies in real time.<br />Through a centralized dashboard and mobile app, citizens can request help, locate nearby shelters, and report urgent needs.<br />Volunteers and NGOs are automatically matched to requests based on proximity, availability, and skills.<br />Relief agencies can visualize affected zones, manage resources efficiently, and share live updates with local authorities.<br />This coordinated ecosystem reduces overlap, speeds up responses, and ensures equitable distribution of aid.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>When disasters strike, communities often face chaos and disorganization. Victims lack access to real-time information about nearby shelters, food, or medical aid. Volunteers and responders operate without coordination, leading to duplicate efforts in some areas and neglect in others. Aid organizations also struggle with fragmented data and delayed communication, slowing down life-saving interventions.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li><strong>Emergency Response Management - </strong>coordinate requests, volunteers, and logistics across agencies.</li><li><strong>App Engine Studio - </strong>create customized modules for shelter tracking, supply chain updates, and victim registration.</li><li><strong>Virtual Agent - </strong>provide multilingual chatbot support for citizens seeking help or updates.</li><li><strong>Flow Designer - </strong>automate alert notifications, resource assignments, and follow-up workflows.</li><li><strong>GIS Mapping &amp; Performance Analytics - </strong>visualize disaster impact zones, monitor response rates, and analyze coverage.</li><li><strong>Mobile App Framework - </strong>allow responders to capture field data and work offline during connectivity outages.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li>Integration with emergency alert systems, SMS, and satellite communication for low-connectivity regions.</li><li>API connections with weather and disaster monitoring platforms.</li><li>Real-time data synchronization for shelters, hospitals, and volunteer teams.</li><li>Multi-agency authentication and role-based access controls for secure collaboration.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
