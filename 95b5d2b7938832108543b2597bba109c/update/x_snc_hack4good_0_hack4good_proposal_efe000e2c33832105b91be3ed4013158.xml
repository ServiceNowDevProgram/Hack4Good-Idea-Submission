        <problem_statement>Birdwatching is a popular recreational and scientific activity that allows people to connect with nature while contributing valuable data for wildlife research. However, most birdwatchers still rely on manual methods such as notebooks, spreadsheets, or basic mobile apps to record sightings. These methods make it difficult to store, organize, and share birdwatching data efficiently.&#13;
There is also a lack of a centralized digital platform where birdwatchers can collaborate, analyze trends, and access insights about bird species, migration patterns, or local sightings. This limits the potential for community engagement, real-time data sharing, and contribution to conservation efforts.&#13;
To address these challenges, there is a need for a ServiceNow-based application that allows users to log, manage, and share bird sightings seamlessly while fostering collaboration among birdwatchers and researchers.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>We can create this app and contribute to Environment and Conservation Impact</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>We need to have an image intelligence where if a birdwatcher captures a photo, we should be able to populate it&#39;s details (IUCN details)</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Challenge would be maintaining a database where we initially have all details of the birds  </p>]]></solution_proposal>
