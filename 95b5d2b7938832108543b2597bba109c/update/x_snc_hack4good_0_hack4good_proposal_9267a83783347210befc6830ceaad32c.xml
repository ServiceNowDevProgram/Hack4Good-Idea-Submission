</li><li>
<p>Promote community engagement and build a safer, more inclusive support ecosystem for senior citizens.</p>
</li></ol>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Elderly individuals often face challenges in accessing timely assistance for daily needs such as medical emergencies, mobility support, grocery deliveries, or home maintenance. Many senior citizens live alone and may not have immediate family or caregivers nearby. The lack of a centralized platform to request and monitor help often leads to delayed responses, health risks, and emotional distress. Additionally, NGOs and community service organizations struggle to efficiently manage and prioritize these requests due to manual processes and lack of real-time visibility</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>The <strong>Elderly Assistance Request System</strong> will be a centralized ServiceNow-powered portal where elderly users or their caregivers can submit help requests under categories such as <strong>Medical Aid</strong>, <strong>Daily Assistance</strong>, <strong>Transportation</strong>, or <strong>Wellness Check</strong>.</p>
<p>Key features envisioned:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Service Portal:</strong> Simple and accessible interface for elderly users or caregivers to log requests.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Automated Assignment:</strong> Requests routed to the nearest volunteer, NGO, or medical team based on availability and location.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Priority Management:</strong> Critical cases (like health emergencies) automatically flagged for urgent attention.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Mobile Notifications:</strong> Real-time alerts for both requesters and responders.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Dashboard &amp; Reporting:</strong> Analytics on types of requests, response times, and volunteer engagement.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Integration with External Services:</strong> Such as emergency response (ambulance, local hospitals) and government welfare databases.</p>
</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>
<p>Integration with <strong>external systems</strong> such as emergency services (ambulance dispatch, hospitals) and <strong>communication tools</strong> (SMS gateways, WhatsApp notifications).</p>
</li><li>
<p>A <strong>mobile-friendly interface</strong> or mobile app for elderly users and volunteers.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reliable <strong>geolocation services</strong> to identify nearby responders.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Data security and privacy measures to protect elderly user information.</p>
</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>
<p>Ensuring the <strong>usability and accessibility</strong> of the platform for elderly individuals with limited digital literacy.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Managing <strong>data privacy and consent</strong>, especially for health-related information.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Recruiting and training volunteers or NGOs to effectively use the platform.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Integration with <strong>external healthcare and emergency systems</strong>, which may use different data standards.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Maintaining <strong>real-time response</strong> and service availability, especially in rural or low-connectivity areas.</p>
