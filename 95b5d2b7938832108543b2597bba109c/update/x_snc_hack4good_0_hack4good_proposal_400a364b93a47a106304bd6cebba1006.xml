<p>This also helps reduce your carbon footprint.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Around 92 million tonnes of textile waste are produced every year.&#13;
We live in a society that loves shopping — and as our kids grow, their clothes no longer fit. Often, we end up throwing them away or donating them.&#13;
This app aims to solve that problem by enabling clothing exchange, reducing waste, and promoting sustainability instead of letting good clothes end up in the garbage.</problem_statement>
