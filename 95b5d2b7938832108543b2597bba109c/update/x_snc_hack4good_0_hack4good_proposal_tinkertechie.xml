            - How it helps people: Supports rural health workers and clinics by providing early alerts for conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or infectious diseases, improving early intervention and healthcare outcomes.
            - Tech stack you would use: ServiceNow for workflow and record management, AI/ML models (Python, TensorFlow), REST APIs, mobile-friendly dashboards for health workers.
