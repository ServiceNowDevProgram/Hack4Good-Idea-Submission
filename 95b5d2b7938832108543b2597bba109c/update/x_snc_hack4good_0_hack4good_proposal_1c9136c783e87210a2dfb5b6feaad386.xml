        <problem_statement>During natural disasters or emergencies (floods, earthquakes, fires, etc.), affected individuals often struggle to find timely and accurate information about nearby shelters, medical aid, food distribution points, and emergency contacts. Traditional communication channels are slow, fragmented, or inaccessible, especially for vulnerable populations.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>ResQBot would be a multilingual <strong>Virtual Agent</strong> accessible via web, mobile, and messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS). Users could ask questions like:</p>
<ul><li>Where is the nearest shelter?</li><li>How do I get medical help?</li><li>Is my area safe?</li></ul>
<p>The bot would respond with verified, real-time data from government and NGO sources. It could also:</p>
<ul><li>Accept incident reports from citizens (e.g., blocked roads, missing persons)</li><li>Route urgent cases to field service agents</li><li>Provide mental health support links and emergency contacts</li></ul>
<p>A backend dashboard would allow relief coordinators to monitor requests, resource usage, and emerging hotspots.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li>APIs from emergency services, NGOs, and government databases</li><li>Location services (GPS or IP-based)</li><li>Multilingual NLP support for accessibility</li><li>Optional integration with SMS gateways or WhatsApp Business API</li></ul>
<p> </p>
