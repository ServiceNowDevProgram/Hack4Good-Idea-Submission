        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>GreenCycle Exchange transforms IT asset retirement into a sustainability-driven reuse initiative. The solution enables organizations to donate usable devices to schools and NGOs while ensuring secure data sanitization and transparent tracking. With automated pickup scheduling, donation approvals and sustainability dashboards, it showcases measurable outcomes like reduced e-waste, lower carbon footprint, and digital inclusion for under-resourced communities. Over time, it promotes a circular economy mindset and aligns with global ESG goals.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>In large organizations, decommissioned laptops, monitors, and peripherals often end up stored indefinitely or discarded, even when they’re still usable. Without a proper donation process or tracking mechanism, these assets contribute to e-waste and lost value.</problem_statement>
