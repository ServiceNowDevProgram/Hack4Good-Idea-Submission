        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li>ServiceNow Incident Management: For logging, categorizing, and tracking safety reports.</li><li>Flow Designer and Automation Engine: To automate routing, notifications, and follow-up tasks.</li><li>Service Portal: Provides an intuitive, secure front-end for students and staff to submit reports and check status.</li><li>Performance Analytics: For real-time dashboards and trend analysis on incident data.</li><li>Mobile App Capabilities: Allowing users to report incidents or receive alerts on-the-go.</li><li>Virtual Agent (Optional): To guide users through reporting or provide safety resources via chat.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li>User Authentication Integration: Connect with campus identity management systems (e.g., SSO, LDAP) for secure login.</li><li>Data Privacy and Security Controls: Ensure compliance with campus data policies and legal requirements for confidentiality.</li><li>Integration with Campus Security Systems: Optionally link to existing emergency alert systems, CCTV, or access control where available.</li><li>Mobile Device Support: For app-based reporting and notifications.</li><li>Analytics and Reporting Tools: For advanced data visualization and export capabilities.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
