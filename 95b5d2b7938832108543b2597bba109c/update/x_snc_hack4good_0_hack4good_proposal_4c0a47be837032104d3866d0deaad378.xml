        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>Increased Apprenticeship Enrollment (25%): By making opportunities visible and the application process simple, more students are guided into vocational tracks.</p>
<p>Reduced Employer Time-to-Hire (30%): Employers gain access to a pre-vetted, qualified pipeline of candidates with easily verifiable certifications.</p>
<p>Economic Mobility: Provides marginalized youth and low-income students with equitable access to high-value career pathways, combating socio-economic barriers.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Many high school students and young adults are unaware of non-traditional career paths, such as apprenticeships, vocational training, and skilled trade certifications, which often lead to high-paying, essential jobs without the debt associated with a four-year degree. The current process of connecting students to these opportunities is highly manual and fragmented:&#13;
&#13;
Discovery Barrier: Students don't know what apprenticeships exist or how to apply for them.&#13;
&#13;
Tracking Inefficiency: Local trade schools and employers struggle to manage the application pipeline and track the progress of candidates through multiple training phases.&#13;
&#13;
Credential Visibility: There is no centralized system to track and verify micro-credentials or certifications earned by the apprentice, making it hard for employers to quickly verify a candidate's full skillset.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Service Catalog </p>
<p>Virtual Assistant </p>
<p>Service portal</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Integration with School Databases (Optional): To verify prerequisites like grades or course completion securely.</p>
<p>Digital Credentialing API (Optional): To issue industry-standard, verifiable digital badges.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Stakeholder Buy-in: Gaining adoption from all three necessary groups: high schools, multiple local employers (e.g., HVAC, construction), and regional trade organizations.</p>
<p>Data Standardization: Standardizing the highly variable application requirements and training phases across different trades and employers.</p>
<p>Security and Privacy: Securely managing student personal information and academic records while making employment and training history easily verifiable for employers.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
