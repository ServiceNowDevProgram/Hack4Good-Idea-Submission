        <problem_statement>Communities living near rivers are often at high risk during heavy rains or flood seasons. Many residents do not receive timely information about rising water levels or flood warnings, leading to loss of property, displacement, and even loss of life.&#13;
Traditional communication methods, such as radio announcements or manual alerts are often delayed, unreliable, or inaccessible to people in remote or low-connectivity areas. There is a clear need for a centralized, automated, and easily accessible digital platform to monitor water levels and promptly alert residents and authorities.</problem_statement>
