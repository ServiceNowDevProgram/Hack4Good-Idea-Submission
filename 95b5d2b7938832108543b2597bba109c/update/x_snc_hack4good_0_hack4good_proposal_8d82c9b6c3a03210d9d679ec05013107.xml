        <problem_statement>Edible food is wasted because food banks lack real-time inventory and distribution tools. Food banks receive huge, unpredictable donations of perishable goods (like fresh produce and meat) that are nearing expiration. They rely on manual processes (phone calls, email) to match this volatile supply with the specific, immediate needs of local pantries. This delay and lack of visibility mean a significant amount of food spoils before it can be distributed, worsening hunger and wasting resources.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A central, real-time logistics platform that connects food donors, the food bank, and distribution agencies (pantries, shelters) via a simple, mobile-first interface:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Real-Time Inventory (CMDB/Asset):</strong> Every incoming donation is instantly scanned or logged as a digital &#34;Food Asset&#34; with key data (weight, type, expiration date). The food bank has a single, real-time view of all available inventory across all warehouses.</li><li><strong>Donor/Agency Portal:</strong> Donors (grocers, manufacturers) use a simple portal to post their surplus food instantly. Recipient agencies (pantries) use a mobile app to instantly view available inventory and place &#34;orders&#34; based on their current client needs.</li><li><strong>Flow Designer &amp; Dispatch:</strong> Automates the matching process: If a donation of 100 gallons of milk is available, the system automatically checks which agencies have requested milk and creates the most efficient delivery route or pickup schedule for the driver, eliminating manual paperwork and phone calls.</li><li><strong>Mobile App for Drivers:</strong> Drivers receive their optimized routes and log pickups/deliveries on a mobile app, updating the inventory status instantly upon drop-off.</li></ul>
