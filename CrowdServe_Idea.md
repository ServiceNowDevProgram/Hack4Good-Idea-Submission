# 🤝 CrowdServe – Community Volunteering & Social Impact Coordination Platform

## Title
**CrowdServe – A Platform to Organize and Mobilize Volunteers for Social Causes**

## Problem Statement
When communities face challenges—such as waste accumulation, seasonal disease outbreaks, or natural disasters—citizens are often willing to help but lack a centralized way to coordinate efforts effectively.  
Existing social media platforms are good for awareness, but they lack **structured task management**, **volunteer tracking**, and **impact measurement** capabilities.  
There’s a need for a digital platform that can **connect volunteers, NGOs, and local authorities**, enabling organized and timely community action.

## Proposed Solution
CrowdServe is a ServiceNow-based application designed to simplify the planning and execution of community service events.  
It helps organizers create volunteer requests for causes such as cleaning drives, senior citizen assistance, awareness campaigns, or disaster relief — and helps volunteers discover and join initiatives in their area.

### Key Features
- 📢 **Campaign Creation:** Organizers (NGOs, local bodies, citizen groups) can post events like “Park Cleaning Drive” or “Flood Relief Support.”  
- 👥 **Volunteer Enrollment:** Citizens can view nearby campaigns and register interest.  
- 📍 **Location & Schedule Management:** Supports geolocation tagging and shift scheduling for efficient coordination.  
- 🔁 **Task Assignment Workflow:** Distributes specific roles (medical aid, logistics, awareness) using automated task flows.  
- 📱 **Real-time Updates:** Send notifications for event reminders, cancellations, or task completion.  
- 🧾 **Impact Dashboard:** Tracks metrics like volunteers mobilized, hours contributed, and areas covered.  
- 🌍 **Disaster Response Mode:** Enables rapid volunteer request broadcasting during natural calamities.  

## Social Impact
- Fosters community participation and civic responsibility.  
- Accelerates response time during emergencies and social causes.  
- Encourages collaboration among NGOs, citizens, and local governments.  
- Creates measurable social impact through organized volunteerism.

## Technical Approach (ServiceNow Use)
- Use **Flow Designer** to automate volunteer request approval and assignment.  
- Create **Custom Tables** for campaigns, volunteers, and participation records.  
- Build an interactive **Service Portal / UI Builder** interface for event browsing and registration.  
- Integrate with **Google Maps API** for nearby event discovery and directions.  
- Use **Notifications and Mobile App (Now Mobile)** for updates and task completion logs.  
- Add **Performance Analytics dashboards** for event tracking and impact visualization.
