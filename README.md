## A Special Partnership: Hack4Good

We are thrilled to announce that we are partnering with our friends at Hack4Good!

Typically, ServiceNow Hack4Good is a hackathon where developers, partners, and customers create real-world solutions for nonprofit organizations. After two successful years at the Knowledge conference, Hack4Good is spreading its wings into more year-round events, and our Hacktoberfest is one of its first stops!

This project is a new **Hack4Good Ideation Portal**. The records you contribute will be ideas and app suggestions that will fuel future Hack4Good initiatives. You'll learn how to contribute records to a ServiceNow repo, and your contributions will directly support future social impact projects.
