# 🌱 EcoTrack – Community Environmental Action Tracker

## Title
**EcoTrack – A Platform to Track and Amplify Local Environmental Actions**

## Problem Statement
Local environmental initiatives—like tree planting, waste cleanup drives, and recycling campaigns—often happen in isolated pockets.  
There’s little coordination, limited visibility, and no measurable way to track impact or engage recurring volunteers.  
Communities need a digital hub to organize, track, and recognize sustainable actions while building a sense of shared responsibility for the planet.

## Proposed Solution
EcoTrack is a ServiceNow-based platform that helps citizen groups, schools, and NGOs organize and measure environmental activities.  
It enables users to post eco-events, register volunteers, and visualize the collective environmental impact of their efforts.

### Key Features
- 🌳 **Event Creation:** Organizers can post local environmental activities (tree planting, lake cleaning, recycling drives, etc.).  
- 👥 **Volunteer Registration:** Citizens can discover nearby events and sign up easily.  
- 📍 **Location Tagging:** Use map integration to display event areas.  
- 🔁 **Impact Tracker:** Measure metrics like trees planted, waste collected, CO₂ saved.  
- 🧭 **Gamification:** Award badges and points for consistent contributors.  
- 📈 **Impact Dashboard:** Display community progress and participation statistics.

## Social Impact
- Strengthens environmental awareness at the grassroots level.  
- Promotes citizen engagement and measurable sustainability outcomes.  
- Builds data for local authorities and NGOs to improve green initiatives.  
- Encourages healthy competition and collaboration among communities.

## Technical Approach (ServiceNow Use)
- Use **Custom Tables** for events, volunteers, and environmental metrics.  
- **Flow Designer** for event approvals and notifications.  
- **Service Portal / UI Builder** for event browsing and registration.  
- Integrate with **Google Maps API** for geolocation tagging.  
- Add **Performance Analytics** to track metrics (trees, waste, CO₂ saved).  
- Use **Gamification / Scoring** for volunteer recognition and leaderboard.
