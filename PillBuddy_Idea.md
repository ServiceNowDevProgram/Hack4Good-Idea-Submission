# 💊 PillBuddy – Medicine Sharing & Redistribution Platform

## Title
**PillBuddy – A Platform to Redistribute Unused Medicines to Those in Need**

## Problem Statement
Every year, large amounts of medicines remain unused in homes, hospitals, and clinics. These medicines are often discarded, leading to wastage and environmental harm, while low-income communities in developing regions struggle to access essential drugs. There is no streamlined, trustworthy mechanism to collect, validate, and redistribute unused but safe medicines to those who need them.

## Proposed Solution
PillBuddy aims to create a secure and transparent medicine-sharing ecosystem powered by ServiceNow.  
The platform connects medicine donors (individuals or pharmacies) with verified NGOs and health centers who can redistribute safe, unexpired medicines.

### Key Features
- 🩺 **Medicine Listing Portal:** Donors list available medicines with expiry, quantity, and packaging details.  
- 🔍 **Verification Workflow:** Local health volunteers or partner NGOs verify donations using approval flows.  
- 📦 **Matching & Fulfillment:** The system matches requests from recipients with available medicines based on location and category.  
- 📊 **Donation Tracking:** Full audit trail from donor → verifier → receiver to ensure compliance and transparency.  
- ⚖️ **Analytics Dashboard:** Displays metrics on waste reduced, beneficiaries reached, and active donors.

## Social Impact
- Reduces pharmaceutical waste and supports sustainable healthcare.  
- Improves access to essential medicines in under-served communities.  
- Builds a socially responsible ecosystem through digital transparency.

## Technical Approach (ServiceNow Use)
- Use **Flow Designer** for multi-level donation verification and assignment.  
- Use **App Engine Studio** or **Custom Tables** to manage medicine inventory and requests.  
- Implement **Service Portal / UI Builder** for donor and NGO interfaces.  
- Integrate with **Maps API** for location-based matching and logistics coordination.  
- Include optional **email/SMS notifications** for approvals and collection reminders.
