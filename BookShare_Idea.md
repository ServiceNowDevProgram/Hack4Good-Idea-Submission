# üìö BookShare ‚Äì Community Book Exchange Platform

## Title
**BookShare ‚Äì A Smart Platform for Sharing, Exchanging, and Donating Books**

## Problem Statement
Students and readers frequently have books that go unused after exams or after finishing a novel, while others cannot afford or access them easily. Despite the rise of digital content, there is no reliable local platform for people to exchange, lend, or donate books conveniently and safely.

## Proposed Solution
BookShare provides a centralized ServiceNow-based solution that enables individuals, schools, and communities to exchange or lend books ‚Äî from academic textbooks to storybooks ‚Äî fostering affordable access to learning and reading materials.
