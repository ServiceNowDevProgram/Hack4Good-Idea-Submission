Submit a Pull Request: In your GitHub repository, submit a new pull request against the main branch of Hack4Good, from your fork and branch. Steps are listed below:

Go to the original repository and click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
Click "New Pull Request" and select your branch.
Ensure your pull request has a descriptive title and comment that outlines what changes you made.
Only include files relevant to the changes described in the pull request title and description. In this case, it should ideally just be x_snc_hack4good_0_hack4good_proposal_{sys_id}.xml file.
Avoid submitting XML exports of ServiceNow records independently.

That's it! A Developer Advocate or a designated maintainer from the ServiceNow Dev Program will review your pull request. If approved, it will be merged into the main repository for everyone's benefit (and then everyone can sync their fork again to have it included ðŸ˜‰)!

Note on Multiple Submissions

If you plan to submit another pull request while your original is still pending, make sure to create a new branch in your forked repository first!

General Requirements

Descriptive Pull Request Titles: Your pull request must have explicit and descriptive titles that accurately represent the changes made.
Scope Adherence: Changes that fall outside the described scope will result in the entire pull request being rejected.
Quality Over Quantity: Low-effort or spam pull requests will be marked accordingly.

Thank you for contributing! Your efforts help create a richer resource for the ServiceNow development community.
