# 🛡️ SafeNeighbour – Local Safety & Alert Network

## Title
**SafeNeighbour – A Community-Driven Safety and Emergency Alert Platform**

## Problem Statement
In many semi-urban and rural areas, residents face safety risks—such as local hazards, floods, fires, or community emergencies—without a coordinated alert or response mechanism.  
Social media spreads information, but not always to the right people at the right time.  
Communities need a structured and verified system to report, alert, and coordinate responses to neighborhood safety issues.

## Proposed Solution
SafeNeighbour is a ServiceNow-based application that enables communities to quickly report hazards, send alerts, and organize volunteers or coordinators for immediate action.  
It functions as a local network for neighborhood safety, fostering trust and collaboration among residents.

### Key Features
- 🚨 **Incident Reporting:** Citizens can submit hazard reports (e.g., flood, fire, stray animals, road damage).  
- 📢 **Alert Broadcast:** Sends targeted alerts to nearby users or volunteers.  
- 👥 **Volunteer Tasking:** Assigns specific response tasks (e.g., first aid, clearing debris, checking on elderly).  
- 🗺️ **Incident Map View:** Displays all reported issues with location pins and status.  
- 🔔 **Real-Time Notifications:** Sends push or email alerts for urgent safety updates.  
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard:** Tracks common issues and response times for better preparedness.

## Social Impact
- Improves neighborhood-level emergency preparedness.  
- Builds a culture of shared responsibility and trust.  
- Reduces response time during emergencies.  
- Enhances collaboration between citizens, NGOs, and local authorities.

## Technical Approach (ServiceNow Use)
- Use **Custom Tables** for incidents, alerts, and tasks.  
- **Flow Designer** for routing reports and assigning volunteers.  
- **Service Portal / UI Builder** for citizens to report and view incidents.  
- Integrate **Map Widgets / Google Maps API** for real-time visualization.  
- Use **Performance Analytics** to measure incidents, response time, and resolution rate.  
- Enable **Notifications and Mobile App (Now Mobile)** for instant community alerts.
