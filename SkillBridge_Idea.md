# 🧰 SkillBridge – Empowering Unorganized Labor through Training and Employment

## Title
**SkillBridge – A Platform to Organize, Upskill, and Connect Unorganized Labor with Global Opportunities**

## Problem Statement
Millions of unorganized laborers—such as daily wage workers, school dropouts, and uneducated individuals—struggle to find stable employment due to lack of visibility, proper training, and digital inclusion.  
NGOs and government programs exist to help them, but there’s no centralized system to identify, train, and connect this workforce with domestic or international opportunities.  
This results in **wasted human potential**, **mismatched jobs**, and **persistent unemployment** in vulnerable communities.

## Proposed Solution
**SkillBridge** is a ServiceNow-based application designed to connect **unorganized laborers**, **NGOs**, **skill-development agencies**, and **government employment departments** on a single digital platform.  
The platform helps collect worker profiles, identify skills and interests, conduct training sessions, and match trained individuals with verified job opportunities — both local and abroad.

### Key Features
- 🧑‍🏭 **Worker Registration:** NGOs or field officers can register individuals, capturing their basic info, location, skill set, and work interest.  
- 🎯 **Skill Assessment & Recommendation:** Suggests suitable training programs or job roles based on profile data.  
- 🧰 **Training & Certification Management:** Tracks workshops, skill courses, and progress status.  
- 🌏 **Job Matching Engine:** Connects trained workers to available opportunities within India or abroad.  
- 🛫 **Migration Assistance:** For international placements, the app coordinates visa, travel, and document processing.  
- 🧾 **Government & NGO Dashboard:** Monitors participation, training effectiveness, and employment rates.  
- 🔔 **Notifications & Mobile Access:** Keeps candidates updated on training schedules, job interviews, and placement status.

## Social Impact
- Provides digital identity and visibility to the unorganized labor sector.  
- Reduces unemployment through targeted skilling and job-matching programs.  
- Supports government initiatives for workforce mobilization and inclusive economic growth.  
- Enables international workforce collaboration between developing and developed countries.  

## Technical Approach (ServiceNow Use)
- **Custom Tables** for workers, skills, training sessions, and job listings.  
- **Flow Designer** for workflow automation — registration → training → job placement.  
- **IntegrationHub** to connect with government APIs or job boards.  
- **Service Portal / UI Builder** interface for NGOs and field agents to enter data easily.  
- **Performance Analytics Dashboards** to track training success and job placements.  
- **Now Mobile App** for workers to view training progress and new opportunities.
